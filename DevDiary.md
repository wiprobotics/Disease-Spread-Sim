<h1><strong>Dev diary for the production of my COMP250 artefact</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

This is a diary of my development process for my COMP250 artefact. I will be using this diary to keep track of my progress and to reflect on my development process. This diary will be split into eras, each of which will be a separate section. The eras will be split by major changes in the creation of the project, such as the addition of a new feature or the completion of a major milestone.

For each era, I will include a description of the changes made, a reflection on the development process, and a list of the changes made. I will also include a list of the changes made in each era in the table of contents. To also keep the citations section short all citations will be done in the era they are mentioned; this does mean that some citations may be repeated.

<h2><strong>Era 1: Deciding which AI to use (Research)</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Changes made</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Decided which AI to use for the project</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Introduction to era</strong></h3>

The main goal of this era was to decide which AI to use for the project. There are a few requirements I had for the AI, these were:
<ul>
<li>It must be able to be used in a 2D top down environment, as I dont want to make a whole 3d environment</li>
<li>It must be python based, as I am most familiar with python</li>
<li>Preferably it should be able to be used in godot or pygame as I want a visualisation of the agents</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>AI 1: PyGame Learning Environment (PLE)</strong></h3>

My first choice was PLE [1] as it fufilled all of my requirements; PLE is a python library which add reinforcement learning to pygame. It has a number of game examples, for instance flappy bird which really helped in my research as I could see how it worked. However once I looked into developing my own AI's in PLE it became obvious that this was not the AI for me; the primary reason for this is that PLE didn't seem to have alot of documentation that wasn't about their prebuilt games. This meant that I would have to spend alot of time trying to figure out how to use the library, which would take away from the time I could spend on the project. I also found that the library was not very well maintained, with the last commit being in 2016 [2]. This meant that if I had any issues with the library I would have to fix them myself, which would take away from the time I could spend on the project.
